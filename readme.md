# Sleep Cycle Calculator

This project is a Sleep Cycle Calculator that recommends optimal wake-up times based on sleep cycles if you go to bed at the current time.

The application is built with a Flask backend for calculating wake-up times, and a React frontend for a user-friendly interface. The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS and includes a dark theme for comfortable viewing.
